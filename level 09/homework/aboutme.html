<p>Hi!</p>
<p>My name is <u><b>Mate</b></u>. I'm 15 years old. I was born in 2009 7th january. I live in Kutaisi, Georgia's the oldest town. I have two siblings: the brother <i><b>Ioane</b></i> and the sister <i><b>Martha</b></i>. She is 2 years old and Ioane is 4. I love them so much! I study at Merab Tschokhonelidze's School and I'm 9th grade student. I prefer more the humanitarian objects then technical, for instance:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>Georgian</li>
  <li>English</li> 
  <li>History</li>  
  <li>Biology</li>     
</ul>
<p>By the way I'm passionate with the sport, like swimming and boxing. I also like to work out.</p>
<p>When I joined GOA, after that my hobby became programming. Here you can learn the most things, which will come in handy. for example:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Python</li>

    <li>html</li>
    <img src="html.png" width = 200>
    <li>css</li>
    <img src="css.png" width = 200>
    <li>javascript</li>
    <img src="javascript.png" width = 200>
    

</ol>


 <p><b>and etc.</b></p>
